# Classify Real and AI-Generated Synthetic Images

In recent years image-creating AI technology has advanced rapidly. With DALL-E 2, midjourny, Dreamstudio, and more fake image AI models approximately 2 million AI generated images are created each day. This is incredible technology that can be used for a variety of interesting and helpful tasks. However, there are many dangers to AI generated images.

Scams, misinformation, propaganda, plagiarism and identity theft are all common over the internet, and can be propelled forward with the use of image-faking AI. Being able to distinguish between real and fake images will help combat the negative uses of this technology. Our project is designed to differentiate between real and fake images, using a Convolutional Neural Network trained on a dataset of real and AI generated images.
